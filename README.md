# CS 245 Project 02: MassiveMotion

### Overview

Project 02: Massive Motion is a Java simulation that visualized celestial objects moving across a 2D space. A star and . Comets are displayed moving in varying velocities and directions.
To store and manipulate celestial bodies, different lists implementations can be used. The MassiveMotion class controls the main simulation of the celestial objects. Java Swing is used for graphics and a timer for animation.


## List Implementations

To store and manipulate these celestial bodies, the project includes multiple list implementations to show different data structures. ArrayList implements a dynamic array, implements a singly LinkedList, DoublyLinkedList implements a doubly linked list, and DummyHeadLinkedList uses a dummy head node to simply insertion. All list classes implement the List interface that defines list operations.
